# Semantic Alignment for Data Products

This repository offers a practical pattern for aligning semantic meaning across business reference models, sector vocabularies, and distributed data products — especially where multiple teams and systems must collaborate coherently.

It focuses on making meaning, structure, and ownership visible across organisational layers, rather than leaving alignment to informal agreement.

---

## Why this exists

When data products, models, and vocabularies are developed independently, shared meaning often dissolves into assumption.

As a result:

- Business concepts drift from technical models  
- Processes lose their data grounding  
- Teams interpret “the same” concepts differently  
- Governance becomes reactive instead of structural  

This project explores how to keep **business intent, sector semantics, and data products structurally connected** in environments where shared understanding can no longer be assumed.

## What this explores

This repository experiments with aligning:

- **Enterprise steering logic** (Nbility)  
- **Sector semantics** (NBNL vocabulary, CIM)  
- **Data products and domain ownership**  

It does so by:

- Using **Nbility** to anchor data products in enterprise capabilities and processes  
- Using the **NBNL vocabulary** as a shared business language  
- Linking business concepts to **CIM classes and profiles**  
- Making **asset and function layers** explicit  
- Respecting **multiple perspectives** (grid, market, enterprise)  
- Treating data products as **structural components**, not just containers  

The goal is not to create one “perfect model”, but to make alignment **visible, testable, and reusable** across teams.

## Focus areas

- CIM / NBNL semantic alignment  
- Business-to-technical concept mapping  
- Asset & function layer separation  
- Multi-perspective modelling  
- Data product semantics  
- Interoperability patterns  
- Governance through structure, not policy  

---

## Goals

- Connect enterprise processes (Nbility) to sector semantics (NBNL / CIM)  
- Anchor data products in shared meaning  
- Preserve structural distinctions instead of flattening them  
- Support coherent collaboration in distributed teams  
- Provide reusable architectural artefacts  

---

## How to use this repository

- Start with the conceptual pattern in `docs/`  
- Explore `examples/` for concrete alignment cases  
- Use `models/` for structural or semantic representations  
- Add your own cases to refine the pattern  

This is a working space, not a finished framework.

## Status

Work in progress — focused on clarity, not completeness.  
This is a conceptual + technical exploration.

# Semantic Alignment for Data Products

This project explores how **semantic models, sector standards (CIM / NBNL), and data products** can be structurally aligned to improve interoperability, governance, and system coherence.

## Why this exists

Many organisations implement:
- Data products  
- Metadata tools  
- Reference models  
- Domain vocabularies  

But these elements often remain **loosely connected**.

This repository experiments with:

- Mapping business concepts to CIM classes  
- Using sector vocabularies as semantic anchors  
- Treating data products as modelling components  
- Making alignment *visible* and *testable*  

## Focus areas

- CIM / NBNL semantic alignment  
- Business-to-technical concept mapping  
- Data product semantics  
- Interoperability patterns  
- Governance through structure, not policy  

## Status

Work in progress — focused on clarity, not completeness.

# Semantic Alignment for Data Products

This repository explores how semantic models (CIM, sector vocabularies, SKOS)  
can be aligned with data products to improve interoperability, governance,  
and architectural coherence in complex infrastructure domains.

## Goals
- Map business concepts to CIM classes and profiles  
- Connect Nbility / bounded contexts to semantic definitions  
- Demonstrate how data products can act as modeling components  
- Provide reusable artifacts for teams and architects  

## Status
Work in progress. This is a conceptual + technical exploration.

# Semantic Alignment for Data Products

This repository offers a practical pattern for **operationalising existing sector semantics** across distributed data products and teams.

It builds on established foundations, such as **Nbility**, the **NBNL vocabulary**, and the **CIM profiles**, and focuses on making their use **explicit, coherent, and reusable** in data mesh–style environments.

Rather than introducing new models or vocabularies, the goal is to connect what already exists to how data is actually produced, shared, and owned.

## Why this exists

In many organisations, strong semantic foundations already exist:

- Business reference models (e.g. Nbility)  
- Sector vocabularies (e.g. NBNL)  
- Technical semantic standards (e.g. CIM)  

However, when data products and domain teams are introduced, these foundations are often applied **implicitly**.

As a result:

- Business concepts drift from technical models  
- Processes lose their data grounding  
- Teams interpret “the same” concepts differently  
- Governance becomes reactive instead of structural  

This repository explores how to keep **existing semantic foundations** structurally connected to **data products and team ownership**.

## What this explores

This repository works with:

- **Enterprise steering logic** (Nbility)  
- **Sector semantics** (NBNL vocabulary, CIM profiles)  
- **Data products and domain ownership**  

It adds a practical alignment layer by:

- Anchoring data products in **existing business concepts**  
- Using the **NBNL vocabulary** as the semantic reference  
- Linking concepts to **CIM classes and profiles**  
- Making **asset and function layers** explicit  
- Respecting **multiple perspectives** (grid, market, enterprise)  
- Treating data products as **structural components**, not just containers  

The goal is not to create a new model, but to make **semantic usage visible, testable, and reusable** across teams.

## Focus areas

- CIM / NBNL semantic alignment  
- Business-to-technical concept anchoring  
- Asset & function layer separation  
- Multi-perspective modelling  
- Data product semantics  
- Interoperability patterns  
- Governance through structure, not policy  

---

## Goals

- Connect enterprise processes (Nbility) to sector semantics (NBNL / CIM)  
- Anchor data products in shared meaning  
- Preserve structural distinctions instead of flattening them  
- Support coherent collaboration in distributed teams  
- Provide reusable architectural artefacts

## How to use this repository

- Start with the conceptual pattern in `docs/`  
- Explore `examples/` for concrete alignment cases  
- Use `models/` for structural or semantic representations  
- Add your own cases to refine the pattern  

This is a working space, not a finished framework.

## Status

Work in progress — focused on clarity, not completeness.  
This is a conceptual + technical exploration.
